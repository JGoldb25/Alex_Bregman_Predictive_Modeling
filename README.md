Predicting WRC+ for Alex Bregman Career Trajectory

-	In evaluating of Alex Bregmanâ€™s MLB trajectory, I focused on predicting his WRC+ over the rest of his career
-	Additionally, in collecting the data for my research, I found the data on Fangraphs and Baseball Reference, organizing the data in Excel before cleaning it in R, through several steps, including re-identifying data columns as numeric and vice-versa for character data
-	When building my model to determine WRC+ for Alex during his projected next eight years of his career, I looked at predictors strongly connected with offensive production, including wOBA, OBP, Batting Average, and SLG (%)
